        <p>
            Kennedy is my name, but you can call me KenPress. I'm currently on a path towards a career in web development and design. The digital world has always fascinated me, and I'm excited to turn that passion into a profession. When I'm not coding or designing, you'll often find me exploring the great outdoors, hiking, and capturing the beauty of nature through photography. I am with a I.T technician company, but I'm pursuing further education to transition into the world of web development.</p>

<p>I'm pursuing a WDD degree at BYU-Idaho, and I absolutely love the supportive learning environment here. What excites me most about learning web design is the endless creativity it offers. I'm taking this course to gain practical skills, explore new career opportunities, and hopefully, one day, create websites that inspire and inform others. I believe that in today's digital age, understanding web design is essential, and I'm eager to apply this knowledge both personally and professionally.</p>

<p>I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for five years, and one of my favorite quotes from our leaders is "Educate your minds and hands, qualify yourselves for the work to which you are called. You live in a day of advancement; and your education, if properly pursued, will fit you for usefulness here and for exaltation hereafter."  —  Brigham Young. As for a favorite scripture, I find inspiration in "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths." — Proverbs 3:5-6</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you and sharing this educational journey together. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or chat about web design, outdoor adventures, or anything else.</p>
